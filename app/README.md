# Emotional Recognition Web-Based Application for those with ASD
I have developed this application for my dissertation. The idea of this web-based application is to enable those who have a diagnosis gain an understanding in being able to recognose the different emotions. The user will have the ability to create an account, login, take a quiz, track their progess and view their achievements. 

# The Quiz
The users will be asked 10 random questions. They will have a image shown to them and they have 10 seconds to answer each question, the users will also be give three different emotions of what the think the person in the photo is displaying. Once the user picks an option they will be automatically moved onto the next question. If the user runs out of time they will be automatically moved onto the next question. When the user finishes the quiz they will be shown their % score. 

# Learning Zone
The Learning Zone has the emotions which the users could be asked to identify on the Quiz. When they select on a particular emotion they should be redirected to another page that will give them a short video on facial ques that can be seen on someone who is displaying that emotion. 

# Achievements
When the user goes to the achievements section of the web-based application they will be shown their achievements if they have any. The achievements that a user can achieve is the following: 
•	Taken the test for the first time
•	Spent 1 hour in the learning zone 
•	Beat your previous quiz score 
•	Achieved 100% in the quiz for the first time
•	Achieved 100% in the quiz three times in a row 

When the user achieves an achievement they will be given a badge with the description of what their achievement is

# Progress 
The progress page will show the user a chart with the number of attempts that the user has completed and the % that they gained in all their test.
